### Todo:

- [ ] Convert syntax into std style;

- [ ] Check cmake pthread compile needs;
- [ ] Review todo;
- [ ] Add "this" to all class members [should i?];
- [ ] Add portable version;
- [ ] Test framework;
- [ ] Pass compiled tags "pendantic";
- [ ] Upgrade documentation (make it fancy);
- [x] Add namespace;
- [x] Update documentation;
- [x] Review Request and Response;
- [x] Review _processRequest (Server);
- [x] Think another way to handle PAYLOADS (sendSuccess, etc);
- [x] Think a better way to store Requests and Response's attr;

- [x] Fix lambda function into server > consumer creation [changed to std::mem_fn, than i regret and use lambda again];
- [x] Move splitText to another section;
- [x] Analyze if changing vector to queue will be better in performance (i think yes) in _queue on server.h [queue won];
- [x] Update (create one '-') documentation;
- [x] ~~Make dynamic listener threads that escalate as requests are coming~~ instead of doing that i'm listing the threads cpu capacity and using them as _thread_count;
- [x] Add lock to _listen bool attr;
